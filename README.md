It's battleship!
This project's purpose was mostly to practice MVC role seperation, RSpec testing, and general OOP.
However, it was really fun, and I've implemented a fully featured battleship game running from the terminal. The AI is not implemented yet (it shoots randomly), but a super intelligent probability-matrix driven AI is soon to come!

#### Setup
1. you need the colorize gem: `gem install colorize
2. run `ruby main.rb`
